### Environment Configuration

- The API base URL is configured using the `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_URL` environment variable, defaulting to 'https://api.bereketakiso.com' if not set.

### Example API Calls

Here are examples of how the API calls are structured for different content types:

1. Projects:
   ```typescript
   const fetchProjects = async (): Promise<ProjectData[]> => {
     return apiCall<ProjectData[]>({
       method: 'GET',
       url: '/api/projects',
       params: { populate: '*' },
     });
   };
   ```
   Full URL: https://api.bereketakiso.com/api/projects?populate=*

2. Blog Posts:
   ```typescript
   const fetchBlogPosts = async (): Promise<BlogPostData[]> => {
     return apiCall<BlogPostData[]>({
       method: 'GET',
       url: '/api/blog-posts',
       params: { populate: '*' },
     });
   };
   ```
   Full URL: https://api.bereketakiso.com/api/blog-posts?populate=*

3. About Page:
   ```typescript
   const fetchAboutData = async (): Promise<AboutData[]> => {
     return apiCall<AboutData[]>({
       method: 'GET',
       url: '/api/abouts',
       params: { populate: '*' },
     });
   };
   ```
   Full URL: https://api.bereketakiso.com/api/abouts?populate=*

4. Experiences:
   ```typescript
   const fetchExperiences = async (): Promise<ExperienceData[]> => {
     return apiCall<ExperienceData[]>({
       method: 'GET',
       url: '/api/experiences',
       params: { populate: '*' },
     });
   };
   ```
   Full URL: https://api.bereketakiso.com/api/experiences?populate=*

5. Skills:
   ```typescript
   const fetchSkills = async (): Promise<SkillData[]> => {
     return apiCall<SkillData[]>({
       method: 'GET',
       url: '/api/skills',
       params: { populate: '*' },
     });
   };
   ```
   Full URL: https://api.bereketakiso.com/api/skills?populate=*

6. Certifications:
   ```typescript
   const fetchCertifications = async (): Promise<CertificationData[]> => {
     return apiCall<CertificationData[]>({
       method: 'GET',
       url: '/api/certifications',
       params: { populate: '*' },
     });
   };
   ```
   Full URL: https://api.bereketakiso.com/api/certifications?populate=*

### Explanation of "?populate=*"

The `?populate=*` parameter is a query parameter used in Strapi API calls to include all related data in the response. Here's what it does:

- In Strapi, content types can have relationships with other content types (e.g., a blog post might have an author, categories, or media attachments).
- By default, these related fields are not included in the API response to keep responses lightweight.
- Adding `?populate=*` tells Strapi to include all related data for the requested content type.
- This is useful for getting complete data in a single API call, but it can make the response larger and potentially slower for complex relationships.

For example, when fetching a project with `?populate=*`, the response might include not just the project's basic fields, but also any associated images, tags, or other related content types that have been defined in the Strapi backend.

Note: While `populate=*` is convenient for development, in production you might want to be more specific about which fields to populate to optimize performance.

## üé® Styling

CyberPortfolio uses a combination of Tailwind CSS and custom styles to achieve its sleek, responsive design:

### Tailwind CSS

- Tailwind classes are applied directly in JSX for utility-first styling.
- The project uses Tailwind CSS v3.4.1 (as specified in `package.json`).
- Tailwind configuration is extended in `tailwind.config.ts` to customize the theme.

### Custom Styles

- Global styles are defined in `app/globals.css`.
- This file includes Tailwind directives and any additional custom CSS.

### Dark Mode

- The project implements a dark mode theme optimized for readability.
- Dark mode styles are likely toggled using Tailwind's dark mode feature.

### Responsive Design

- The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- Tailwind's responsive utilities are used to adjust styles across breakpoints.

### Component-Specific Styling

- Components like `AuthorBadge`, `about-page`, and `blog-page` may have specific styles applied.
- These styles are typically a mix of Tailwind classes and occasional custom CSS.

### Syntax Highlighting

- Code blocks in blog posts or project descriptions use syntax highlighting.
- This is likely implemented using a library like `react-syntax-highlighter`.

### Image Optimization

- The Next.js Image component is used for optimized image loading and display.
- Image handling is configured in `next.config.js` to work with the Strapi backend.

### Customizing Styles

To modify or extend the styling:

1. Use Tailwind classes directly in component JSX for most styling needs.
2. Add or modify custom styles in `app/globals.css` for global style changes.
3. Extend or override Tailwind's default configuration in `tailwind.config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   module.exports = {
     theme: {
       extend: {
         // Add custom colors, fonts, etc.
       },
     },
     variants: {
       // Add custom variants
     },
     plugins: [
       // Add Tailwind plugins
     ],
   }
   ```
4. For complex components, consider using CSS modules or styled-components if needed.

### Style Guidelines

- Maintain consistency with the existing design system.
- Prefer Tailwind utilities over custom CSS when possible.
- Use semantic class names for custom styles.
- Ensure styles are responsive and work well in both light and dark modes.

### Performance Considerations

- Tailwind's purge feature is used in production to minimize CSS file size.
- Avoid large, unused style imports that could impact load times.

By leveraging Tailwind CSS and following these guidelines, CyberPortfolio maintains a consistent, performant, and easily maintainable styling approach.
